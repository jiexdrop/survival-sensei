# Player 2 AI NPC Plugin for Godot
The Official Player2 AI NPC Plugin for Godot

The Player 2 AI NPC Godot plugin allows developers to easily create AI NPCs in their Godot projects.

The plugin uses free AI APIs from the [player2 App](https://player2.game/)

Just open Player2, and the plugin connects automatically, so you can dive right into building your world instead of wrestling with keys or settings. When your game is ready, weâ€™ll share it with our community of 40,000+ active players eager for AI-driven adventures [on our discord](https://player2.game/discord)

## Usage Guide

### Installing the plugin

[The plugin is available in the godot asset library](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/4097)

### Adding the node
First, add a Player 2 AI NPC Node

Then, open the node and modify the description of the agent

## Talking to the Agent

To talk to the agent, call it's `chat` function. To notify the agent of stimuli from the world, call it's `notify` function.

For example, we have a simple interface example with a `text_sent` signal that is fired when the user types in a chat box and presses enter. This can get hooked into the `chat` function to talk to the agent.

Hearing back from the agent can be done with the agent's `chat_received` signal. Hook this up to a function that can read the agent's reply.

## TTS and Player 2 Launcher Characters

Access TTS support and the characters from the Player 2 launcher using the Character Config

## Tool Calling

First, create a script that contains functions that the agent will call.

Then, add this script to an empty `Node`.

Then, drag the new node into the `Scan Node for Functions` property in the AI NPC node

You should now see a list of functions with their descriptions below:
